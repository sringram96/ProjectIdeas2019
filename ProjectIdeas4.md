I wanna add features to a cool opensource project called Habitica

-----------------------------------------------
I found an interesting RCOS project called OpenCircuits.
Then again I'm a CSE/CS dual so it's more down my alley.
It's a digital circuit simulator.

Big fan of [Pokemon Showdown](https://github.com/Zarel/Pokemon-Showdown) 
for recreation, would be nice to be a part of that community.
[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) or contributing
to the Go language would be a more compelling set of challenges and more
impressive
